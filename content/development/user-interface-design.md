# User Interface Design

Our goal for the Civitas user interface (UI) is to blend functionality with the game's medieval aesthetic. We want players to feel immersed in the world while having easy access to all the information and controls they need.

## Design Principles

*   **Clarity:** Information should be presented clearly and concisely, avoiding clutter.
*   **Intuition:** Players should be able to understand how to interact with the UI without extensive tutorials.
*   **Aesthetics:** The UI elements are designed to complement the game's visual style, using textures and motifs inspired by medieval manuscripts and architecture.
*   **Responsiveness:** The UI adapts to different screen resolutions and aspect ratios, ensuring a consistent experience.

## Current Progress

We've finalized the layout for the main city management screen, including resource displays, building menus, and citizen happiness indicators. Work is now progressing on the diplomacy and research interfaces.

We are conducting internal playtests to gather feedback on UI usability and will make adjustments based on player experience.
