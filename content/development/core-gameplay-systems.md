# Core Gameplay Systems

Developing the core gameplay systems for Civitas has been a monumental task, focusing on creating a robust and engaging experience. We've concentrated on three main pillars:

## 1. Resource Management

Our resource system is designed to be intuitive yet deep. Players will manage various resources like food, timber, stone, and rare minerals. Production chains are interconnected, meaning a shortage in one area can have cascading effects across your nation.

## 2. Political Factions

Internal politics play a significant role. Different factions within your nation (e.g., military, merchants, clergy, commoners) will have their own demands and loyalties. Balancing their needs and suppressing dissent will be key to maintaining stability.

## 3. Diplomacy & Warfare

Interacting with other nations involves a complex diplomacy system, allowing for alliances, trade routes, and treaties. When diplomacy fails, our warfare system offers tactical depth, requiring strategic unit placement and understanding of terrain.

We are continuously refining these systems to ensure a balanced and challenging gameplay experience.
